"""
This file demonstrates the coupling between an object of the
core code of pyrate (CoreObject) and its FreeCAD representation
(FreeCAD_CoreObject). It is used as basis of the discussion
about the interface between both code parts.

At the moment the philosophy is the following:
CoreObject is independent of FreeCAD_CoreObject due to decoupling
of script code from frontend code. Communication between both
takes place via an observer interface. FreeCAD_CoreObject is the
observer of Core_Object, which is appropriate. The problem is
that we actually have three objects involved. The third object
is the FreeCAD object which is created in the TreeView and which
carrys the properties to be coupled to CoreObject. Therefore
FreeCAD_CoreObject somehow takes the role of the coupling element
between both. Question is: Is it possible to design the coupling
between object in TreeView and CoreObject in a reusable, simple
to use manner? From my point of view the variant given below is
too tightly coupled.
